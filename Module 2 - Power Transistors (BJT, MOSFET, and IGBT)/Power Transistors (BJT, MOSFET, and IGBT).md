# Power Transistors (BJT, MOSFET and IGBT)
## Introduction
A power transistor is a semiconductor device specifically designed to handle high levels of current and voltage while maintaining the ability to switch controlled at high speed. Unlike small-signal transistors, which are optimized to amplify low-level signals, power transistors are built and designed to support and control significant flows of electrical energy. The fundamental distinguishing feature of power transistors is their ability to operate as electronically controlled switches. This means they can quickly toggle between their on and off states, blocking the flow of current by presenting high impedance.

## Theoretical Framework
### BJT Power Transistors
A BJT power transistor is a bipolar junction semiconductor device designed to operate in applications where control and handling of high levels of current and voltage are required. Its principle of operation is based on the modulation of the collector current through a small current applied to the base, which allows for the amplification of electrical signals or acts as a power switch. In terms of applications, BJT power transistors are used in high-power audio amplifiers, linear and switched power supplies, output stages in motor controllers, lighting systems, and generally in any circuit where it is necessary to handle significant electrical loads.

The configurations applied to BJT power transistors are the same as those applied in BJT transistors typically used in low-power circuits, but there is a key difference: although they are the same configurations, there are practical differences, for example:
- In BJT transistors ordinary, the focus is primarily on amplifying small signals, high gain, and speed.
- In BJT power transistors, the priority is the ability to handle high currents and voltages, which is why they require higher base currents to enter conduction.
