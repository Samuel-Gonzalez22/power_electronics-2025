# Power Transistors (BJT, MOSFET and IGBT)
##Introduction
A power transistor is a semiconductor device specifically designed to handle high levels of current and voltage while maintaining the ability to switch controlled at high speed. Unlike small-signal transistors, which are optimized to amplify low-level signals, power transistors are built and designed to support and control significant flows of electrical energy. The fundamental distinguishing feature of power transistors is their ability to operate as electronically controlled switches. This means they can quickly toggle between their on and off states, blocking the flow of current by presenting high impedance.
